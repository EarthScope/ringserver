- mxmlLoad* and mxmlSAXLoad* did not properly create text nodes when
  MXML_TEXT_CALLBACK was specified (Bug #531)
- mxmlDelete used a recursive algorithm which could require large amounts of
  stack space depending on the file (Bug #549, CVE-2016-4570)
- mxmlWrite* used a recursive algorithm which could require large amounts of
  stack space depending on the file (Bug #549, CVE-2016-4571)
