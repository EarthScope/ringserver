2015.188:
	- Fix parsing of MaxClientsPerIP configuration parameter when the
	MaxClients parameter is also being specified.
	- Allow connections from addresses that have write permission even
	when the maximum number of connections has been reached.  The reserve
	space is currently 10 connections.
	- Clarify in documentation that clients connecting from the localhost
	loopback address (127.0.0.1) is only granted write permission if no
	other addresses are explicitly granted write permission.

2015.182:
	- Dynamically allocate record buffer for use in slclient.c:HandleInfo()
	in order guarantee that it is properly aligned for the host architecture.
	Thanks Doug Neuhauser for identifying this issue (under Solaris x86).

2015.156:
	- Update pcre to 8.37.
	- Add 'MaxClientsPerIP' config parameter and -M command line option to
	enforce a maximum number of connections per IP address.  The limit does
	not apply to addresses with write permission.  Default is no per-IP maximum.
	- Copy pcre/pcre_chartables.c.dist to pcre/pcre_chartables.c to avoid
	symbolic link problems on, for example, Cygwin.

2015.149:
	- Update libmseed to 2.16m.
	- Restart listening server threads (SeedLink and DataLink) without
	initializing the server socket when the socket is already set up.
	- Continue accept()ing new connections and do not exit if the accept()
	returns an error of ECONNABORTED or EINTR.  These errors are
	non-critical and should not cause the listening thread to exit.
	- InitServerSocket(): close socket on error return from setsockopt() to
	avoid leaving an open socket in that error condition.
	Thanks to Doug Neuhauser for reporting and suggesting above fixes.
	- Close corrupt ring buffer file when performing autorecovery in 
	all cases.

2015.074:
	- Update libmseed to 2.15.
	- Update pcre to 8.36.  Note: development of pcre has moved to pcre2.
	- Update mxml to 2.9.
	- Improve detection of ring corruption by adding a 'corruptflag' to the
	ring parameters, setting it in RingWrite() and checking it on initialization.
	This will trigger consistent corruption detection on initialization
	whenever the previous execution ended when RingWrite() detected an error.
	- mseedscan.c: rearrange stored directory entry listing details to avoid
	needing to copy potentially variable length struct dirent.  This code now
	works on platforms without dirent.d_reclen support, e.g. Cygwin.  Thanks
	to Eric Thomas for reporting this.

2014.269: Dudes!
	- Update mxml to 2.8.
	- Update pcre to 8.35.
	- Update libmseed to 2.13.
	- Changes to support much larger SeedLink requests:
	a) Increase max internal regex buffer size from 65,536 to 1,048,576 by
	changing SLMAXREGEXLEN and DLMAXREGEXLEN.
	b) Increase max buffer for per-station/global selectors from 400 to 2,048.
	c) Configure the PCRE lib to use an internal link size of 4 instead of 2.
	The effective limit depends on the composite selection, e.g. number of
	STATIONs and number SELECTions per STATION.  With 6 selections each,
	over 10,000 stations may be requested.  Over 200 selectors for a
	request with fewer stations.  Requests can now be unreasonably large.
	- Optimize packet search loop in RingAfter() and RingAfterRev(), which
	are used to position a reader based on packet time, by avoiding the
	regex tests when possible. Suggested code by Mark Chadwick.
	- Include offset in the regex pattern in the error message printed when
	pcre_compile() returns an error.
	- Improve error messasges in slclient.c when RingMatch() or
	RingReject() return failures.
	- Add " ..." to log messages that were truncated at 200 characters.
	- Add example of using Match with the MSeedScan option to the man page.
	- Clean up Makefile and src/Makefile.

2014.007:
	- Increment transmission packet count per stream for SeedLink clients;
	for transmission logging, packet counts were previously zero, byte
	counts were (and remain) correct.

2013.284:
	- When writing miniSEED, properly handle the case where all files
	associated with a DataStream would be closed because the idle time
	out reached 0 by making sure the current entry does not get closed.
	This can happen when all currently open files (max of ~40) have been
	opened within the last second.
	- Cleanup getaddrinfo related memory and re-join signal handling
	thread on shutdown for completeness (and to make valgrind happy).

2013.280:
	- Change permissions of miniSEED writing mode to 777 for directories
	and 666 for files.  An operator can control the final permissions of
	the files and directories by setting the umask.

2013.278:
	- Update to libmseed 2.12.
	- In RingReadNext(), avoid a reader from falling off the trailing edge
	of the buffer by repositioning the search to the earliest packet when
	the target packet is not found.  If the target packet is not the next
	expected packet and does not exist in the ring it is very likely that
	read position has fallen behind, off the trailing edge.  Thanks to
	Doug Neuhauser for raising this issue and suggesting a fix.
	- Add command line option -STDERR to send all console output to stderr
	instead of stdout.

2013.192:
	- Increase SLMAXREGEXLEN and DLMAXREGEXLEN from 16384 to 65536 to
	support larger request selections.

2013.170:
	- Update libmseed to 2.11.
	- Update pcre to 8.33.

2013.161:
	- Log server port number with client connection message.

2012.317:
	- Store match and reject strings for DataLink clients correctly.
	- Change SLMAXREGEXLEN to match DLMAXREGEXLEN of 16384.

2012.313:
	- Increase limit on number of SeedLink selectors that may be
	specified per station by increasing the limit on the composite
	string length that contains these selectors.
	- Update pcre to 8.31.

2012.126:
	- Remove spinlock on ring parameters for read access.  Nearly all
	modern architectures guarantee that reading and writing integer
	primatives is atomic.  This means locking is not needed for readers
	of the ring parameters.  Good thing, it was a performance killer.
	- Add checking to ring positioning routines to guarantee that the
	reader position is only updated with consistent packet details.

2012.125:
	- Update pcre to 8.30.
	- Update mxml to 2.7.

2012.120:
	- Update libmseed to 2.6.2.
	- Revert the previous locking scheme that equated readers and writers,
	while technically correct the server could not scale to DMC needs.
	Instead, a new scheme with a mutex for writers and a spin lock to control
	access to ring header parameters that change during operation has been
	implemented for readers.

2011.262:
	- Fix crash bug when SeedLink INFO command is received with no level.

2011.242:
	- Update libmseed to 2.6.1.
	- Patch minixml library for correct handling of va_list structures on
	amd64 architectures.

2011.211:
	- Add rslock.c and rslock.h with generalized lock routines that can
	be switched between spinlocks and mutex locks.
	- Use the rslock mechanism to lock the ring for all access.

2011.143:
	- Use ClientInfo.socketerr to indicate clean shutdown of connection
	to avoid logging ugly error messages when client has disconnected.
	
2011.141:
	- Create a dedicated signal handling thread and block signals from
	all other threads to avoid any signal handling by child threads. 
	- Rework storage and initialization of ring and stream locks.
	- Add mutex locking to all ring read operations, all ring access
	including both reading and writing is mutually exclusive.  This is a
	conservative and safe design, hopefully not too slow.

2011.066:
	- Update libmseed to 2.6 final.

2011.049:
	- Update libmseed to 2.6 release candidate.
	- Update pcre to 8.12.
	- Accept '-' characters in SeedLink selectors which are translated
	to space/blank location IDs, this allows explicit selection of blank
	or space-space location IDs by specifying the location as '--'.
	- MSeedScan: Remove file modification time check from update check,
	files will be processed if they have increased in size. Avoids
	skipping data being written very quickly, thanks to Doug Neuhauser.

2010.103:
	- Fix small bug in dsarchive.c, related to globbing detection
	for non-defining flags.

2010.075:
	- Update pcre to 8.01.
	- Add SeedLink BATCH command support to suppress acknowledgment
	(OK and ERROR) for all recognized commands, unrecognized commands
	return ERROR.
	- Bump SeedLink protocol version identifier to 3.1.
	- Move _REENTRANT compiler declaration into CFLAGS in src/Makefile.

2010.072:
	- Update to libmseed 2.5.1.
	- Add LimitIP parameter to configuration file to set limits on access
	to specific streams from specific IP addresses, a dynamic parameter.

2010.025:
	- Calculate scan time for MSeedScan server threads and include in
	STATUS info request results.

2010:020:
	- Update to libmseed 2.4.
	- Parse optional file names from stream IDs for Mini-SEED writing,
	if file names are present they will be appended to the DataStream
	archive definition (i.e. the DataStream defines a base directory).

2010.018:
	- Track count of ClientInfo.streams in ClientInfo.streamscount and
	include as StreamCount attribute in XML return for CONNECTIONS.
	- Add byte and packet rate calculations to Mini-SEED scanning thread.

2010.016:
	- Add ServerThreads element to XML return for STATUS info with thread
	specific details.

2010.013:
	- Fix parsing of MSeedScan suboptions from config file.
	- Add InitCurrentState suboption for MSeedScan that controls behavior
	on initial startup, allowing the scanning to skip old data and start
	reading only newly added data.
	- Change initialization error return flagging in MS_ScanThread() to 
	TDF_CLOSED.

2009.326:
	- Convert printing of int64_t and uint64_t quantities to use the PRId64
	and PRIu64 macros in place of %lld and %llu.

2009.324:
	- Update libmseed to 2.3.
	- Update pcre to 8.0.

2009.322:
	- Add -MSSCAN command line option to add a Mini-SEED scanning thread,
	this is the same as the MSeedScan configuration file option.

2009.314:
	- Add Mini-SEED scanning server threads, controlled with MSeedScan
	config file option.

2009.304:
	- Fix crash for corner case of joined client thread and client timeout
	trigger occuring simultaneously.
	- Add CLOSE status printing for client thread list.

2009.302:
	- Reorganize server threads into a list similar to the client threads,
	this allows multiple SeedLink and DataLink ports as well as improved
	architecture for future server threads.

2009.292
	- Add DataLatency element to DataLink STREAMS info return.

2009.170:
	- Update libmseed to 2.2.
	- Update pcre to 7.9.
	- Update libmxml to 2.6.
	- Revert workarounds for bugs in libmxml 2.5 which fixes a SeedLink
	XML INFO creation bug reported by Andres Heinloo.
	- Make all XML INFO records big-endian for consistency.
	- Fix resume bug for SeedLink when multiple stations are selected.

2009.070:
	- Fix off-by-one for day of year of new 'D' archive flag expansion.

2009.069:
	- Add ClientTimeout option/parameter and close client connections
	that have exchanged no packets with the server within a specified
	number of seconds, default is 3600 seconds.
	- Add 'D' flag to archiving format options that expands to a current
	local year-day time stamp in the form of 'YYYYDDD'.

2008.338:
	- Update pcre from 7.4 to 7.8.
	- Write man page and fill out usage message.

2008.325:
	- Turn on TCP_NODELAY option (turning off Nagle alorgithm) for all
	client connections.

2008.290:
	- Rework parsing of config file options to use more tranditional
	types for systems that do not fully support C99 integer types.
	- Remove includes for stdint.h, correct definitions are picked
	up through other includes.

2008.282:
	- Change mutex lock positions to avoid race condition with
	client stream trees.
	- Rearrange diagnostic messages to differentiate incoming
	connections from accepted new client connections.

2008.281:
	- Move IP->hostname resolution into client-specific threads so
	the listening threads are not waiting an unknown amount of time
	for DNS results.
	- Rework socket handling to use protocol-independent interfaces,
	paving the wave for potential IPv6 support in the future.
	- Change the deadlock timeout from 5 to 10 seconds when shutting
	down all client threads.

2008.279:
	- Change IP-to-host resolution for SeedLink listener to be the
	same as DataLink listener, neither use the NI_NOFQDN option.

2008.277:
	- Add %h => hostname translation to MSWRITE capability.
	- Add HSDAY (host-station-day) predefined layout.
	- Improve readability of diagnostic message when send() failed
	for DataLink protocol by replacing non-printable characters.

2008.260:
	- Return value from RingWrite() of -2 now indicates that ring
	corruption was detected, this will now trigger a shutdown as
	continuing to run with an out-of-sync/corrupt ring is no good.
	- Fix race condition bug causing crash in CalcStats where
	the ClientInfo member reader was not yet allocated.
	- Fix regression in SeedLink selector handling.

2008.256:
	- Add packet end time information to the ring packet header and
	modify the DataLink WRITE command and PACKET response to include
	both the packet start and end times.
	- Change RingAfter and RingAfterRev to test reference time against
	the packet data end time instead of start time.
	- Include volatile ring status in DataLink STATUS info responses.
	- Include packet and stream end times in DataLink info responses.
	- Properly handle case of clients connecting to an empty ring and
	receiving all data when it arrives.

2008.255:
	- Improve robustness of reading data from the network sockets by
	implementing timeouts for network reads and use select() to avoid
	repeated reads for non-blocking sockets.

2008.251:
	- Listen for DataLink connections by default, previously no DataLink
	listening thread was started unless specifically configured.
	- Allow listening ports to be disabled by setting the port number to 0.
	- Remove the -SLp and -DLp command line options and change the -SL and -DL
	command line options to take a port number.
	- Add MseedWrite mode where all received /MSEED packets are optionally
	written to a user specified disk archive.  In general, ringserver is
	data format agnostic, this format-specific feature is unique.
	- Add volatile ring mode where ring contents are not written to disk
	files during operation or shutdown.  In this mode the ring is not
	stateful between restarts of ringserver.

2008.250:
	- Add MatchIP configuration parameter to limit connections to
	specific IPs or networks.

2008.247:
	- Further improve corner case handling for SeedLink protocol
	negated selectors.

2008.246:
	- Fix SeedLink protocol handling of negated selectors by matching
	all channels from a station in addition to rejecting the selection.

2008.232:
	- Update libmseed to 2.1.6.

2008.231:
	- Allow DataLink CONNECTIONS requests to match client hostnames in
	addition to IP addresses and client IDs.
	- Optionally resolve and store hostnames upon client connection and 
	indepedently store IP and port strings.
	- Add config file parameter ResolveHostnames to control resolution
	of hostnames.
	- Config file parameter NoMemMap -> MemoryMapRing, change sense.
	- Config file parameter NoAutoRec -> AutoRecovery, change sense.
	- Add client specific send buffers to ClientInfo structure, using
	these buffers avoids allocating memory for each DataLink packet send.
	- Change meaning of -Rp command line argument and MaxPacketSize
	config file parameter to refer to max packet data size not including
	ring packet header, i.e. 512-byte packets need a 512 byte setting.
	- Add txbytes and rxbytes elements to StreamNode and use to track
	the total transmitted and received bytes per client and stream.
	- Re-work transfer log system to write both transmitted (TX) packet
	and byte counts and received (RX) packet and byte counts, adding
	TransferLogTX and TransferLogRX config file parameters to control
	the writing of these logs.

2008.196:
	- Add more ringserver details to Status element of INFO packets.
	- Include size of packet data when reporting initialization.

2008.193:
	- Add a "PACKETSIZE" flag to the DataLink capabilities string
	- Sync capabilities returned in ID and INFO commands.

2008.172:
	- Add a "WRITE" flag to the DataLink capabilities string when
	a client has write permission, in this way the server communicates
	this information to the client before a WRITE command is sent.

2008.124:
	- Look up stream entries for earliest and latest packets during
	ring initialization as a ring corruption sanity check.

2008.084:
	- For SeedLink if no packets were found for time-windowing start
	times position reading at the next packet instead of returning
	an error.

2008.080:
	- Make the clientcount variable from ringserver.c global and use
	it in DataLink INFO responses instead of doing a separate count.
	- Add the Status element to all DataLink INFO responses.

2008.074:
	- Add auto recovery from ring corruption, when initialization of
	the ring fails move the ring packet buffer and stream index files
	to .corrupt versions and re-initialize the ring.
	- Add NoAutoRecovery option to parsing of ring configuration file
	to turn off the auto recovery.
	- Add a fluxflag byte to RingParams and use it in RingWrite to
	indicate when the ring is in flux (changes occuring).  This flag
	is checked on initialization and corruption is assumed if the flag
	is set.

2008.070:
	- Accept match expresion with DataLink INFO CONNECTIONS request and
	apply to client address string and client ID.  Allows limiting the
	returned client list to specific clients.
	- Include separate counts of selected and total connections and
	streams in the DataLink INFO request results.
	- Close potential memory leak triggered by resubmitting match and
	reject expressions.

2008.069:
	- Sort Stack of streams returned by GetStreamsStack() by their
	stream ID.  Results in sorted streams for INFO requests.

2008.066:
	- Change SeedLink INFO CONNECTONS to set the current_seq element to
	"unset" for clients that have no read position (pktid == 0).

2008.065:
	- Add client ID to DataLink INFO CONNECTIONS XML.

2008.064:
	- Fix SeedLink INFO CONNECTIONS XML.
	
2008.063:
	- Convert XML creation to Mini-XML library.
	- Add Mini-XML library sources.
	- Remove EzXML library sources.

2008.060:
	- Include both packet and byte rates in DataLink INFO STATUS output.
	- Change verbose ring initialization output for readability.

2008.059:
	- Add percentlag and lastxchange elements to ClientInfo structure.
	- Update the lastxchange time stamp in slclient.c and dlclient.c
	whenever packets are transmitted or received.
	- Rename CalcRates() to CalcStats() in ringserver.c and add calculation
	of percent lag.

2008.058:
	- Allocate wire packet buffer in SendPacket() and SendRingPacket() to
	allow for arbitrary packet lengths.
	- Restructure thread closing procedure, splitting TDF_CLOSING into two
	separate states: TDF_CLOSING and TDF_CLOSED to avoid race with other
	threads looping over the client thread list.
	- Add PercentLag and Latency calculations to INFO results for DataLink.
	- Add packet data time stamp to RingReader struct as element datatime.
	- Add packet data time stamp to RingParams struct for earliest and latest
	packets as elements earliestdtime and latestdtime.
	- More error testing during creation of INFO XML for SeedLink clients.

2008.057:
	- Implement DataLink INFO requests.

2008.053:
	- Implement most DataLink protocol commands, everything except INFO requets.

2008.011:
	- Initial testing version, fundamental ring functions are all in place,
	the SeedLink protocol support is complete and the DataLink protocol support
	structure in place.
