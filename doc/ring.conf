# count sent to and/or received from each client during the log interval.
# If this parameter is specified and the directory exists, files will
# be written at a user defined interval with the format:

# if write permission is granted.  This parameter can be specified
# multiple times and should be specified in address/prefix (CIDR)
# notation, e.g.: "LimitIP 192.168.0.1/24".  The prefix may be omitted

# Specify IP addresses or ranges which should be specifically allowed
# to connect while all others will be rejected.  By default all IPs
# are allowed to connect.  This parameter can be specified multiple
# times and should be specified in address/prefix (CIDR) notation,
# e.g.: "MatchIP 192.168.0.1/24".  The prefix may be omitted in which
