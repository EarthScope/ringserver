#
# Comment lines begin with a '#' or '*' character.


# Specify the directory where the ringserver will store
# the packet and stream buffers.  This must be specified.

RingDirectory ring


# Specify the ring packet buffer size in bytes.  A trailing
# 'K', 'M' or 'G' may be added for kilo, mega or giga bytes.

#RingSize 1G


# Specify the maximum packet ID.  The maximum ID for SeedLink
# is 16,777,215 (2^16).

#MaxPacketID 16777215


# Specify the maximum packet data size in bytes.

#MaxPacketSize 512


# Listen for connections on a specified port.  By default all supported
# protocols and network protocol families (IPv4 and IPv6) are allowed and
# optional flags can be used to limit to specified protocols/families.
# Protocol flags are specified by including "DataLink", "SeedLink"
# and/or "HTTP" after the port.  Network families are specified by
# including "IPv4" or "IPv6" after the port, default is any supported
# by the system.  For example:
# ListenPort <port> [DataLink] [SeedLink] [HTTP] [IPv4] [IPv6]
# This parameter can be specified multiple times to listen for connections
# on multiple ports.

ListenPort 18000


# Listen for DataLink connections on a specified port.  This is an alias
# for a ListenPort configured with only DataLink allowed.

#DataLinkPort 16000


# Listen for SeedLink connections on a specified port. This is an alias
# for a ListenPort configured with only SeedLink allowed.

#SeedLinkPort 18000


# Specify the Server ID as reported to the clients.  The parameter may
# be a quoted string including spaces.  Default is "Ring Server".
# This is a dynamic parameter.

#ServerID "Ring Server"


# Specify the level of verbosity for the server log output.  Valid
# verbosity levels are 0 - 3.  This is a dynamic parameter.

#Verbosity 0


# Specify the maximum number of clients per IP address, regardless of
# protocol, allowed to be connected concurrently.  This limit does
# not apply to addresses with write permission.  Set to 0 for unlimited.
# This is a dynamic parameter.

#MaxClientsPerIP 0


# Specify the maximum number of clients, regardless of protocol,
# allowed to be connected simulataneously, set to 0 for unlimited.
# This is a dynamic parameter.

#MaxClients 600


# Specify a timeout in seconds after which to drop client connections
# that have exchanged no packets with the server within the timeout
# window, set to 0 to disable.  This is a dynamic parameter.

#ClientTimeout 3600


# Control the usage of memory mapping of the ring packet buffer.  If
# this parameter is 1 (or not defined) the packet buffer will be
# memory-mapped directly from the packet buffer file, otherwise it
# will be stored in memory during operation and only read/written
# to/from the packet buffer file during startup and shutdown.
# Normally memory mapping the packet buffer is the best option,
# this parameter allows for operation in environments where memory
# mapping is slow or not possible (e.g. NFS storage).

#MemoryMapRing 1


# Control auto-recovery after corruption detection.  Be default if
# corruption is detected in the ring packet buffer file or stream
# index file during initialization the ring and stream files will be
# renamed with .corrupt extensions and initialization will be
# attempted a 2nd time.  If this option is 0 (off) the server will
# exit on these corruption errors.  If this option is 1 (the default)
# the server will move the buffers to .corrupt files.  If this option
# is 2 (delete) the server will delete the corrupt buffer files.

#AutoRecovery 1


# Control reverse DNS lookups to resolve hostnames for client IPs.
# By default a reverse lookup is performed whenever a client connects.
# When a reverse DNS lookup fails a small delay will occur, this can
# be avoided by setting this option to 0 (off).
# This is a dynamic parameter.

#ResolveHostnames 1


# Specify a limit, in percent, of the packet buffer to search for time
# windowing requests.  By default the entire packet buffer will be
# searched starting from the earliest packet traversing forward.  If
# this option is set, only the specified percent of the ring will be
# searched starting from the latest packet traversing backward.  To
# turn off time window requsts set this parameter to 0.  This is a
# dynamic parameter, but updated values will only apply to new
# connections.

#TimeWindowLimit 100


# Define the base directory for data transfer logs including both
# data transmission and reception logs.  By default no logs are written.
# This facility will log the number of data packet bytes and packet
# count sent to and/or received from each client during the log interval.
# If this parameter is specified and the directory exists, files will
# be written at a user defined interval with the format:
# "<dir>/[prefix-]txlog-YYYYMMDDTHH:MM-YYYYMMDDTHH:MM" and
# "<dir>/[prefix-]rxlog-YYYYMMDDTHH:MM-YYYYMMDDTHH:MM"
# This is a dynamic parameter.

#TransferLogDirectory tlog

# Specify the transfer log interval in hours.  This is a dynamic
# parameter.

#TransferLogInterval 24

# Specify a transfer log file prefix, the default is no
# prefix. This is a dynamic parameter.

#TransferLogPrefix <prefix>

# Control the logging of data transmission and reception independently,
# by default both are logged.  The TransferLogDirectory must be set for
# any transfer logs to be written.  To turn off logging of either
# transmission (TX) or reception (RX) set the appropriate parameter to 0.
# These are dynamic parameters.

#TransferLogTX 1
#TransferLogRX 1


# Specify IP addresses or ranges which are allowed to submit (write)
# data to the ringserver.  This parameter can be specified multiple
# times and should be specified in address/prefix (CIDR) notation, e.g.:
# "WriteIP 192.168.0.1/24".  The prefix may be omitted in which case
# only the specific host is allowed.  If no addresses are explicitly
# granted write permission, permission is granted to clients from
# localhost (local loopback).
# This is a dynamic parameter.

#WriteIP <address>[/prefix]
#WriteIP <address>[/prefix]


# Specify IP addresses or ranges which are allowed to request and
# receive server connections and detailed status.  This parameter can
# be specified multiple times and should be specified in
# address/prefix (CIDR) notation, e.g.: "TrustedIP 192.168.0.1/24".
# The prefix may be omitted in which case only the specific host is
# trusted. If no addresses are explicitly trusted, trust is granted to
# clients from localhost (local loopback).  This is a dynamic
# parameter.

#TrustedIP <address>[/prefix]
#TrustedIP <address>[/prefix]


# Limit IP addresses or ranges to only specified stream IDs in the
# ringserver.  A regular expression is used to specify which Stream
# IDs the address range is allowed to access (and write), the
# expression may be compound and must not contain spaces.  By default
# clients can access any streams in the buffer, or write any streams
# if write permission is granted.  This parameter can be specified
# multiple times and should be specified in address/prefix (CIDR)
# notation, e.g.: "LimitIP 192.168.0.1/24".  The prefix may be omitted
# in which case only the specific host is limited. This is a dynamic
# parameter.

#LimitIP <address>[/prefix] <StreamID Pattern>
#LimitIP <address>[/prefix] <StreamID Pattern>


# Specify IP addresses or ranges which should be specifically allowed
# to connect while all others will be rejected.  By default all IPs
# are allowed to connect.  This parameter can be specified multiple
# times and should be specified in address/prefix (CIDR) notation,
# e.g.: "MatchIP 192.168.0.1/24".  The prefix may be omitted in which
# case only the specific host is matched. This is a dynamic parameter.

#MatchIP <address>[/prefix]
#MatchIP <address>[/prefix]


# Specify IP addresses or ranges which should be rejected immediately
# after connecting.  This parameter can be specified multiple times
# and should be specified in address/prefix (CIDR) notation, e.g.:
# "RejectIP 192.168.0.1/24".  The prefix may be omitted in which case
# only the specific host is rejected.  This is a dynamic parameter.

#RejectIP <address>[/prefix]
#RejectIP <address>[/prefix]


# Serve content via HTTP from the specified directory. The HTTP server
# implementation is limited to returning existing files and returning
# "index.html" files when a directory is requested using the HTTP GET
# method.
# This is a dynamic parameter.

#WebRoot <Web content root directory>


# Add custom HTTP headers to HTTP responses.  This can be useful to
# enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for example.
# This is a dynamic parameter.

#HTTPHeader "Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *"
#HTTPHeader <Custom HTTP header>


# Enable a special mode of operation where all Mini-SEED records
# received using the DataLink protocol are written to user specified
# directory and file structures.  See the ringserver(1) man page for
# more details.

#MSeedWrite <format>


# Enable a special mode of operation where files containing Mini-SEED
# are scanned continuously and data records are inserted into the ring.
# By default all sub-directories will be recursively scanned.  Sub-options
# can be used to control the scanning, the StateFile sub-option is highly
# recommended.  Values for sub-options should not be quoted and cannot
# contain spaces.
# See the ringserver(1) man page for more details.

#MSeedScan <directory> [StateFile=scan.state] [Match=pattern] [Reject=pattern] [InitCurrentState=y]
